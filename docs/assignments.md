## Exhibit Compare & Contrast

Before we move into the digital world, let's get a sense for how exhibits function IRL. For this assignment, you'll be asked to compare and contrast two physical exhibits in the local area. We will visit some campus exhibit spaces together, but you are also being asked to venture out into the world on your own and visit one of the following spaces:

* [Rockbridge Historical Society](https://rockbridgehistory.org/) - 101 E. Washington St. Open 12-4 on Saturday and Sunday. Some of you might be working on an exhibit that supports the "Rockbridge at Play" exhibit currently on display. 
* [Jackson House Museum](https://www.vmi.edu/museums-and-archives/jackson-house-museum/) - 8 E. Washington St. Open 9-5pm daily. There is an admission cost but the website claims Lexington/Rockbridge residents can visit for free. 
* [VMI Museum](https://www.vmi.edu/museums-and-archives/vmi-museum/) - Memorial Hall, 415 Letcher Ave. Open 9-5 daily. Same note about admission cost as above. 
* [Brownsburg Museum](https://www.thebrownsburgmuseum.org/) - 2716 Brownsburg Turnpike Raphine, VA, 24472 (way out in the county so you'd need a car, lovely drive though!). ONLY OPEN Sept 6-7, 1-4pm. Free. 
* [Miller's House Museum](https://www.millershousemuseum.com/) - 834 Moses Mill Road, Lexington (the stone house at Jordan's Point at the end of Woods Creek Trail). Open Saturday and Sunday 1-4pm. Free. 
* [University Chapel & Galleries](https://www.wlu.edu/academics/libraries-and-museums/institutional-history-museum-and-galleries/visit) - Wednesday-Saturday, 10-5pm. Be sure to check out the basement exhibits. 

**Assignment specs:**

* Due **Thursday 9/18 at 12pm** on Canvas.
* 500-1000 words, or enough to answer all the questions. 
* Choose two exhibits (for small museums, an exhibit = the whole museum). One can be a site we visited together and the other should be one you visit on your own. 
* Answer the following questions about the site you visited on your own:
	* What is this place? Who is the sponsoring organization? 
	* What stuff stood out to you the most during your time there? What was the most interesting part of the exhibit(s)?
	* What would you say is the narrative arc of the exhibit/museum? What story are they trying to tell and what is your evidence for that? 
	* What choices did the curators make? Or, where were areas where you could imagine a curator making a different choice? This could be how things were laid out, the colors used, the way something was described, etc. 
	* How was the visitor experience? Did you feel welcome? Was it clear where to go and what to do? 
	* What did you notice about the design of the space and the exhibit panels? (Feel free to take/include photos). Was the text easy to read? Was it too much or not enough? Was everything labeled? 
	* Were there any interactive elements? 
	* Is there a digital component to this exhibit? 
* Answer the following about both exhibits:
	* Are these exhibits in the same category? Why or why not?
	* What were the similarities? What are the differences?
	* Do you think these exhibits would attract the same audiences? Why or why not?
	* Can you give a few examples of particular choices that the museums made differently? For example, one exhibit might let you wander freely while another insists on a guided tour. 



## Proposal + Preparation


### Part 1: Topic Intentions

Based on our explorations so far, what interests you the most? You'll have time to refine your topic as you go, but we need to move quickly now to get all the pieces put together. This assignment is not formal - I want to see your brainstorming and thinking. 

**Specs:**

* Due 9/23 at noon on Canvas. 
* 200-400 words.
* Answer the following: 
	* What drew you to this class? What skills and knowledge do you want to build? 
	* What topic (library or Rockbridge at play) interest you the most? What about that topic is intriguing? Where might you want to focus that topic? 
	* Which collections are you most interested in working with? 
	* What initial research have you conducted? (If you haven't yet, conduct some!) Share 3-5 sources. These can be sources that provide context for the topic, not just ones that are exactly about this Rockbridge thing.
	* What questions do you have? Concerns? How can I help make group work a good experience? 


### Part 2: Audience + Personas 

As we've learned, personas bring direction and purpose to our work. Let's take what you've read and hear from our guests and create two personas for your exhibit. 

* Due 9/30 at noon on Canvas.
* 200-400 words. 
* Identify two audiences for your work (primary and secondary) and create personas for them. Describe how you will design your exhibit specifically for your audiences. Include any specific details from our talks with KT and Eric. 

### Part 3: Final Proposal 

Okay time to get to business! This is your formal/final proposal. This assignment will be turned in individually, but there are some group writing components, so plan ahead. 

* Due 10/7 at noon on Canvas. 
* 500-1000 words. 
* Group section should be collaboratively written and include the following:
	* Exhibit thesis statement. 1-2 sentences that gives the argument and the "so what" of this exhibit. 
	* Content outline. List the pages of your exhibit and who will be responsible for which. List the distinct collections that your items will fall into. 
	* Collections list. List the main collections you will be working with. Cite formally with collection number, include links to Collection Guide or to digital source (in Digital Archive or other newspapers). 
	* Group charter. One paragraph one how your group will work together based on in-class activity. 
	* Design + branding. One paragraph (with images and color palettes) that summarizes your design approach. How do you want users to feel when they're visiting your exhibit? 
	* Marketing + outreach. One paragraph that addresses how will you draw an audience to your
collection and exhibit? What forms of outreach will you use?
	* Assessment and sustainability. One paragraph. How will you determine the success of
your collection and exhibit? What can you do if your exhibit does not meet your threshold for success? What elements do you need to consider when planning for sustainability? How will you keep your exhibit available in the future?


* Individual section:
	* A list of the 10-15 items that you will include in your exhibit. Indicate which items are from W&L (or RHS) collections and will need to be digitized vs. which are from other sources. 
	* Describe the copyright and privacy landscape of your items and your section of the exhibit. What is in the public domain? Does W&L hold the rights to everything? Are you using material from other sources that will need to be properly credited? Are there privacy concerns for any items? 
	* An outline and short description of your intended page(s) of the exhibit. 
	* Annotated bibliography. List 5 academic/scholarly and 5 non-academic sources in Chicago style with 2 sentence annotations. The first sentence should be a brief summary and the second should be about how it's useful to your research. 



## Collections + Exhibit  

### Digital Collection

As the curator of this exhibit, you get to choose which items are necessary to tell your story! The first big step in putting together your exhibit is to build the collection(s) of items. You indicated which items you were using in your proposal, but if it is necessary to add/remove certain ones, that is okay. If you and another students are sharing an item, you should not add it twice, instead collaborate on the metadata and make it clear in the record that was composed by multiple people. 

Specs:

* Due Tuesday, October 21, at noon. 
* All 10+ items should all be in Omeka. 
* Turn in a short summary of your work in Canvas to satisfy the assignment. Account for any differences from the proposal and the status of your digitization requests. 
* Each item should have a complete Dublin Core record filled out to the best of your ability and as is relevant to each individual item. 
* If you have images available, each item should include a high quality and appropriately cropped image (jpg or pdf format, not tif). 


### Exhibit Wireframe + Outline 

Now that you have your items and have done more research, it's time to start drafting the exhibit itself. This is an individual assignment but you should touch base with your colleagues to make sure you're on the same page. 

Specs:

* Due Tuesday, October 28, at noon in Canvas.
* Turn in 1-2 pages of wireframes and 1 page of exhibit page(s) outline.  
* Your wireframe should included a header, menu, footer, headings, body text, images, captions, and any special features (such as timelines or maps). 
* Your outline should indicate the content and flow of the page or pages for which you're responsible. You don't have to have drafted the content, but you should know what content you will need to write. Where will the images go on the page and how will the correspond with the text? How will your page(s) flow with those of your classmates? 


### Exhibit Page Draft

Let's make sure you're on the right track by turning in a page draft for my review and peer review.

Specs:

* Due Tuesday, November 4, at noon. Turn in link in Canvas. 
* Assemble your items and text into a page. 
* Include 300-600 words and 3+ items. 
* Reference 3-5 of your sources. 


### Digital Exhibit

It's here! Your complete digital exhibit. 

Specs: 
* Due Tuesday, December 2nd, at noon. Link in Canvas.
