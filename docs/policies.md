## Accommodations

I am committed to ensuring access to course content for all students. Reasonable accommodations are available for students with disabilities. Contact Lauren Kozak, Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources, to confidentially discuss your needs and the accommodation process. More information can be found at: https://www.wlu.edu/disability-accommodations/undergraduate-accommodations

If you have already been approved for accommodations, please meet with me within the first two weeks of the term so we can develop an implementation plan together. It is important to meet as early in the term as possible; this will ensure that your accommodations are implemented early on. If you have accommodations for test-taking, please remember that arrangements must be made at least a week before the date of the test or exam.


## Plagiarism

All writing should be your own or should be cited properly. The writing assignments in this course are different than what is required in other courses, so we will discuss proper citation procedures for writing for the Web, writing in a group, and writing technical documentation.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence 

Generative AI should be avoided when completing assignments for this course. Included in this policy are well-known tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, as well as AI features in services like Grammarly (spell check is okay, but the rewriting/outlining features are not). I want the writing and ideas that you submit to be original to your brain. I am interested in what *you* come up with, not a generic version of what you or the AI think I want.

That being said, I am interested in learning from you how gen AI can assist in some of the tasks ahead of us in this course. If you think that gen AI could be useful to our work, you are encouraged to propose an approach that the entire class could use well ahead of turning in an assignment. 

We will be working with sensitive and copyrighted materials in this course so it is important that those material are kept out of generative AI systems unless explicitly allowed to avoid privacy or copyright concerns. We also want to work within professional ethics and norms. 

While it is generally believed that AI use cannot be detected, there are cases where students leave evidence of AI use. I'm not interested in hunting down AI use, but repeated instances of unauthorized gen AI use may constitute an honor violation. 

You should also know that I will not be using AI to grade your work, nor have I used it in preparation of course materials. 

If you have questions or you're unsure, just reach out! I'm not interested in policing behavior, but providing an educational experience where you learn the most you can.
