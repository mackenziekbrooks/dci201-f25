## Specifications Grading
The assignment and grading structure for this course might be a little different than what you're used to. In this course, we'll use a version of an alternative grading system called *Specifications Grading*. The goals of the system are to reduce the stress and mystery of grades while also raising academic standards. I chose this system to complement the technologies and process of our project this term, as well as to combat grade anxiety. 

Instead of awarding letter grades or lots of points per assignment, each assignment will be essentially complete/incomplete. You will be asked to complete a detailed set of specifications for each assignment for the assignment to be marked complete. Due to the public-facing nature of our project in this class, your final public-facing assignments will carry more weight, think of this as "exceeds specifications" vs "meets specifications."

In Canvas, I'll note complete/incomplete with 1 point. If you receive a 0 or incomplete, you have a chance to revise! See the section on tokens below. 

What this means is that your grade will be going up over time (barring any extreme attendance issues). You won't have to worry about a low grade bringing your average down later in the term. 

This is a lot to get used to at first, so please ask any questions you have early in the semester. We will do a midterm check-in so you have a good understanding of where you are.

### Tokens

You're not expected to be perfect at every assignment! To help you recover from any incomplete assignments, you will be assigned **three tokens**. Using a token will give you *one week from receiving the token* to revise and resubmit an assignment to receive credit. To use a token, you must submit an entry in Canvas declaring which assignment you're revising. Then you must re-submit your revised work for the appropriate assignment in Canvas. I'll award a point in Canvas for each token you use, but these points are not factored into your final grade. Using a token does not guarantee that you will receive a complete on the re-submission, but hopefully with my feedback you can get there.

### Attendance Policy 

I get it, life happens. If you need to miss class, please email me in advance (before noon on class day if possible). It helps me plan our activities if I know how many students will be attending and keeps me from worrying that you've fallen in the river. 

That being said, the way I've designed this course means that if you're not in the room, you will miss a lot of learning and work that can't be made up by the reading. Once you have more than **2 absences**, it will affect your grade. Every subsequent absence will decrease your letter grade by one step (B to B-, B- to C+, etc.)

And while I want you to succeed in the next stage of your career, please try to avoid scheduling meetings, interviews, or extra-curriculars during class time. Missing more than 45 minutes of class will constitute a full absence.
