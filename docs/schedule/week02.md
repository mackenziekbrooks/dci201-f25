# Week 2 - Understanding our topics

*In this class, students will work with two topics - the history of the library or "Rockbridge at Play." Let's spend some time digging into those topics and the larger context of local history.* 

**Prep for Tuesday:**

* Spend time (at least 15 min) in [ArchivesSpace](https://archivesspace.wlu.edu/) browsing the collections and getting a sense of the interface and the contents. 
* Spend time browsing the [Rockbridge Historical Society website](https://rockbridgehistory.org/) for a sense of their work.
* Browse the [Rockbridge Epilogues](https://www.historicrockbridge.org/) and the [RHS Proceedings](https://digitalarchive.wlu.edu/islandora/proceedings-rockbridge-historical-society) to see what and how people write about Rockbridge history.
* Spend time with the Crenshaw and Brownell books as provided. 
* As you do all this exploratory research, pay attention to the sources being used/cited. Our goal for Tuesday is to start identifying sources in Special Collections that we will want to consult or include in our project.
