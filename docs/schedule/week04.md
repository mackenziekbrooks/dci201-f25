# Week 4 - Copyright and Privacy

*We need a solid understanding of copyright and privacy when working with archival material, but especially when we put stuff online for the whole world to see.*

**Read at least one of the following:**

    * Add your answers to the whiteboard. There will be a section for "yes - permissible" and "no copyright law does not allow this use."
    * You must show your work! What is your evidence? 
    * The following sites may be useful:
