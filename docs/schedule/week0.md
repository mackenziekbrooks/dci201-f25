# Week 0 - Intros + Curation

*What is curation? What do we know about local + institutional history? And why does it matter?* 

## Thursday, September 4, 2025

* Introductions + Syllabus Day
* Curation activity 
* Blind timeline activity 


**For next week:**

* [How to Curate an Exhibition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDaY6KraDW0) video
* [What Could Curation Possibly Mean?](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2014/03/what-could-curation-possibly-mean/) article

* Read [About Archives](https://www2.archivists.org/about-archives) and look through the links on the [Using Archives](https://www2.archivists.org/usingarchives/) page. 

* We'll be interacting with guest speakers on both Tuesday and Thursday. Please read the Week 1 schedule to come prepared. 

* Your first assignment will ask you to get out in the world and compare two exhibits. Since museums and galleries tend to have particular hours (some are only open on weekends), you might want to get a head start on this assignment this weekend.
