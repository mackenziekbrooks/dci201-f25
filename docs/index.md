## Course description
Students will explore W&L’s history through primary sources in Special Collections and Archives to develop a public-facing online collection of materials and narrative exhibit. This course teaches students how to plan and implement a digital collection and exhibit from the initial concept through the final project. The project management and decision making processes behind each decision will drive the course. Digital projects offer students a valuable alternative to traditional research papers, marrying digital skills with traditional research methods, and this course teaches students how to create and use a framework for digital scholarship they can use in future classes.

Students in this course will make choices and explain their decisions related to creating and gather online collections and presenting their research in a digital exhibit. This course will teach students how to put the audience as the center of their work, deciding who that audience is and making all decisions based on their needs and expectations. This course will give them the skills and organizational abilities they need to approach future digital scholarship projects with confidence and aptitude.

## Course objectives
